# Sansad

Members of the Lok Sabha are elected by adult universal suffrage and a first-past-the-post system to represent their respective constituencies, and they hold their seats for five years or until the body is dissolved.

Here is a simple collection of scrapers for sourcing information about the elected representatives from open data sources.


## Getting the data

	Make a virtual environment, and install the requirements.

	mkvirtualenv Sansad
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	Set VIRTUAL_ENV to the location of your virtual env bin/.

	export VIRTUAL_ENV=~/.virtualenvs/Sansad/bin
